# Our Shared Gifts

Frameworks for coherent exchange, offered freely.

**[oursharedgifts.org](https://www.oursharedgifts.org)**

Recognition Infrastructure — substrate-independent coordination architecture applied to physical, ecological, and technical systems.

## Structure

Static HTML/CSS/JS site hosted on GitHub Pages. No build tools, no framework. Intentionally simple.

- `styles.css` — shared design system
- `menu.js` — mobile hamburger navigation
- `index.html` — landing page
- Framework pages: proto-pattern, four-dynamics, four-thresholds, entry-point, architecture-of-exchange, holding-the-commons
- Project pages: aquaponics greenhouse, mobile crane platform, deployable architecture, hex microclimate, one-acre oasis
- Supporting: about, safety-documentation

## Gift Economy

Everything here propagates because it works, not because it's protected. Documentation, specifications, failures, adaptations — all shared freely. The value is in the demonstration, not the protection.
